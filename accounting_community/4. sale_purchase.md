## 🛒 Purchase Flow: From RFQ to Vendor Bill

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Create a Request for Quotation (RFQ)

**Path:**  
`Purchases → Orders → Requests for Quotation → Create`

| Field              | Value                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Vendor**         | Al-Furqan Traders     |
| **Product**        | Wooden Table          |
| **Quantity**       | 10                    |
| **Unit Price**     | 10,000 PKR            |
| **Subtotal**       | 100,000 PKR           |
| **Delivery Date**  | _(Set manually)_      |

Click **Confirm Order**.  
✅ The RFQ becomes a **Purchase Order**, and a delivery (receipt) is prepared.

### 🔹 Step 2: Receive the Goods

- Click the **Receipts** smart button on the PO.

- Enter product details: Wooden Table x10 @ 10,000 PKR.
