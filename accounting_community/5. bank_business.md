# 🏦 Part 5: Bank Reconciliation & Real-World Business Scenario (Odoo Community Edition)

Odoo Community Edition includes several tools for managing payments and matching them with recorded transactions.  
Let’s walk through a **manual bank reconciliation**, and simulate a **complete business cycle**, using only features available in the Community version.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Record Incoming and Outgoing Payments

Since automated bank reconciliation is **not available** in Community Edition, we’ll manually record transactions:

### Example:  
Go to `Accounting → Payments → Create`

| Field             | Value                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Payment Type     | Inbound (for Customer)      |
| Partner          | Ali Enterprises             |
| Amount           | 75,000 PKR                  |
| Journal          | UBL Bank                    |

➡️ Click **Validate** to confirm the payment.

Repeat for vendor payments using **Outbound** type.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Match Manually with Bank Statements

In Community Edition:

- Reconciliation models are available.
- Uploading bank statements is not automatic.
- Matching is **done manually** from `Accounting → Reconciliation`.

After uploading a statement or creating one manually:

- Choose related journal (e.g., UBL Bank).
- Match lines with existing payments.
- Click **Reconcile** for each item.

✅ Once done, balances match your real bank.
