# 📊 Odoo Community - Real-Life Business Scenario Demo

In this section, we’ll walk through a complete, real-world business scenario using **Odoo Community Edition**, focused on:

- ✅ Basic Accounting  
- ✅ Manual Chart of Accounts  
- ✅ Manual Account Mapping  

We'll begin by configuring the company and importing a custom chart of accounts — the financial backbone of this ERP.

---

## 🏢 Step 1: Company Setup

**Path:**  
`Settings → Users & Companies → Companies`

**Actions:**

- Select your main company
- Fill in the following fields:
  - ✅ Company Name  
  - ✅ Currency (e.g., PKR)  
  - ✅ Tax ID (if applicable)  
  - ✅ Company Logo (optional)

> 📌 Ensure that all key identification fields are filled accurately before continuing.

## 🌍 Step 2: Fiscal Configuration (Manual Setup)

**Note:**  
Odoo Community Edition does **not** support automatic fiscal localizations (like Pakistan). Tax rules, chart of accounts, and fiscal settings must be created **manually** or via custom modules.

> 💡 You may install localization modules from OCA (Odoo Community Association) if available for your country.

## 📥 Step 3: Import Custom Chart of Accounts

**Path:**  
`Accounting → Configuration → Chart of Accounts → Favorites → Import Records`

You can download the sample Chart of Accounts [here](../major_chart_of_accounts.csv).

### ✅ Field Mapping Table:

## 🧾 Step 4: Review Imported Accounts

You should now see all major accounts structured as follows:

### ✅ Sample Account Overview:

| Code   | Account Name       | Type             | Group        |
|--------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 10000  | Fixed Assets       | Non-current      | Assets       |
| 22000  | Account Receivable | Receivable       | Receivables  |
| 24000  | Meezan Bank        | Bank/Cash        | Bank         |

| 70000  | Cost of Sales      | Expense          | Expenses     |

## 🔗 Step 5: Set Default Accounts (Manual Assignment)

In Community Edition, default accounts are assigned through:

- **Journals**  
  `Accounting → Configuration → Journals → Edit`

- **Product Categories**  
  `Sales → Products → Product Categories → Accounting Tab`

**Suggested Defaults:**

| Purpose               | Suggested Account     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Account Receivable    | `22000 - A/R`         |
| Account Payable       | `42000 - A/P`         |
| Bank / Cash           | `24000 - Bank`        |
| Sales Revenue         | `60000 - Revenue`     |
| Expense               | `70000 - COGS`        |

## 🧹 Step 6: Clean Up Default Accounts

**Path:**  
`Accounting → Configuration → Chart of Accounts`

**Actions:**

- Identify unused system-generated accounts (if any)
- Use `Action → Delete` to remove them

✅ Result:
- Clean, custom chart of accounts  
- No duplication or confusion

🎯 **You're now ready to begin customer invoicing, vendor bills, and manual journal entries — all linked to your configured accounting structure.**
