# üì¶ Part 3: Product Setup & Warehouse Configuration (Community Edition)

Now let‚Äôs set up our products ‚Äî both physical goods and services ‚Äî and prepare internal stock locations for basic inventory management.

Accounting-related fields like income/expense accounts can still be configured manually.

---

## üîπ Step 1: Open Products

**Path:**  
`Sales ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Create`

We‚Äôll start with a **storable product** ‚Äî which Odoo will track in inventory.

---

## üîπ Step 2: Create a Storable Product (e.g., Wooden Table)

| Field                  | Value                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Product Name**       | Wooden Table               |
| **Product Type**       | Storable Product           |
| **Sales Price**        | PKR 15,000                 |
| **Cost**               | PKR 10,000                 |

**Inventory Tab:**
- Route: ‚úÖ Buy  
- ‚úÖ Receive in Stock

**Accounting Tab:**

| Account Type   | Suggested Code & Name         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Income Account | `60000 ‚Äì Revenue`             |
| Expense Account| `70000 ‚Äì Cost of Sales`       |

> üí° If Accounting features aren't visible, ensure the "Invoicing" app is installed and Chart of Accounts is configured.

Click **Save** to create the product.

---

## üîπ Step 3: Create a Service Product (e.g., Interior Design)

Repeat the process for a service:

| Field                  | Value                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Product Name**       | Interior Design Service        |
| **Product Type**       | Service                        |
| **Sales Price**        | PKR 50,000                     |

**Accounting Tab:**

| Account Type   | Suggested Code & Name                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Income Account | `60000 ‚Äì Revenue`                    |
| Expense Account| _(Optional)_ `71000 ‚Äì Subcontracting Expense` |

Click **Save**.

‚úÖ Now we have both a tracked item (Wooden Table) and a non-stocked service (Interior Design).

---

## üè¨ Step 4: Enable Storage Locations

**Path:**  
`Inventory ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Settings`

Enable:

- ‚òëÔ∏è Storage Locations

Click **Save** to activate internal location tracking.

> ‚ùå Multi-Warehouse is not available in Community Edition. One warehouse is used by default.

---

## üìç Step 5: Explore Internal Stock Locations

Once storage locations are enabled, Odoo auto-generates internal stock zones.

**Path:**  
`Inventory ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Locations`

Apply filter:  

You‚Äôll see:

| Location       | Description                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| WH/Input       | Incoming goods (pending inspection)       |
| WH/Stock       | Available inventory (ready for sale/use)  |
| WH/Output      | Goods ready to deliver to customers       |

‚úÖ These locations allow precise control over product movement within the warehouse.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Products (both goods & services) are created with pricing and basic accounts  
- Internal storage locations are activated  
- Default warehouse locations (Input, Stock, Output) are visible
