# 🏦 Part 6: Bank Reconciliation & Real-World Business Scenario

Odoo provides built-in tools to help match your real-world **bank transactions** with the system’s internal records.  
Let’s walk through **bank reconciliation**, and then simulate a **complete business cycle**.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Access Reconciliation Screen

**Path:**  
`Accounting → Reconciliation`

Here you’ll see all **unmatched payments** for each Bank Journal:  
✅ Meezan Bank  
✅ UBL Bank

Select **UBL Bank** to view related entries.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Match Transactions

Odoo will show you pending items like:

| Transaction Type   | Example                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Customer Payment   | 75,000 PKR from Ali Enterprises    |
| Vendor Payment     | 100,000 PKR to Al-Furqan Traders   |

➡️ If the payment exists in your real bank statement, click **Reconcile** to match it with Odoo’s internal record.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Bank Balance Synced

After reconciliation:

- Bank journal balance = real bank balance  
- Financial reports are accurate  
- No manual accounting needed

✅ Now your Odoo system is in full sync with your real-world bank data.
